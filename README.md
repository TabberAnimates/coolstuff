### Console.js

To use the console.js script, make a new bookmark and put this as the page url:  
`javascript:x=document.createElement("script");x.src="https://is.gd/SoZxIX"; void document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(x);`  
What this script does is it allows you to make console.log messages without having to open inspect element to type it in!
